# Implementation of Stack with and without linkedlist


 - I have created two programs, One in which I have created a Stack without using Linked List and Second where I have created stack using Linked List.

 - Take a Look at both of them. The thing to understand here is that array in javascript can behave as a stack and have methods like push and pop by default. Its better to know the implementation using core programming logic.
